The styles use [LESS](http://lesscss.org). To get it working, install Node.js
and then [Bower](http://bower.io) and LESS (`npm install bower less`). Then run
`bower install`, which will install a local copy of Twitter Bootstrap v3. Once
changes are made to the `main.less` or `variables.less` files, run `lessc
main.less > main.css` from the `src/` directory.

I included a built version of the stylesheet for convenience.
